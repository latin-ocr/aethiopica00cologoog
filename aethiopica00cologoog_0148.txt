XIX. As soon as it was day, be sum·
moned his chief followers, and ordered
them to bring the plunder, which he called

> by the high-sounding name of “spoils’'
into the midst; he also sent for Cnemon,
with instructions to fetch tbe prisoners
who had been intrusted to his care. While
they were being conducted to the chief,
they exclaimed, “What fate is reserved
for us?” and begged Cnemon to assist
them in any way he could. He promised
to do so, and bade them be of good cheer,
assuring them that the chief of the brigands
was not an utter barbarian, but was ofa
kind and gentle disposition; that he be-
longed to an illustrious family, and had
only adopted his present mode of life from
necessity.

When they reached his presence, and
the whole band had assembled, Thyamis
took his seat upon an eminence in the
island, the appointed meetingplace, and
ordered Cnemon to translate what he said
to the prisoners; for, while he had only Α
an imperfect knowledge of Greek, Cnemon
had now learned to speak Egyptian.
