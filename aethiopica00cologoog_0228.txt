was only a pretext invented to excuse her
murder ; and they demanded that the
supposed adulterer should be produced,
alive or dead, or that, at least, his name
should be given3 lastly, they claimed that
Thisbe should be handed over to them,
that she might be putto the torture. My
father promised, but was unable to pro·
duce her; lor Thisbe, loreseeing what
would happen‚ even before the process
was drawn up, had taken flight with the
merchant, by previous arrangement. The
people, although highly indignant, did not
indeed judge my father to be the murderer
ol his wile, lor he had told them all that ·
had taken place, but expelled him srom
the city as an accessory to the plot against
Demaeneta and to the unjust sentence ol
banishment against mysell, and confis-
cated his property. Such were the fruita
ol his second marriage; and this was how
Thisbe, that vilest ol women, came to
leave Athens, and, as we see, pald the
penalty ol her crimes.
