Ι did as she advised: 1 took a sword,
and proceeded towards my father’s room,
while Thisbe carried a lighted torch in
front. When I came to the door, 1 saw
that there was a light burning inside;
transported with rage, 1 brolre upon the
door, and rushed in, exclaiming, ‘⁴ Where
is the wretch, the fine lover of this most
virtuous woman?'' With these words, 1
advanced, intending to run them both
through with my sword. But, great
heavensl my father leaped out of bed
und¹ fell on his lrnees before me, exclaim· .„

'ingz ‘¹ Ob! my son, restrain yourself ; pity ’ ’ ·
your father3 spare these grey hairs, that

have brought you up. 1 have done you

wrong, it is true; but death would be too

cruel a vengeance. Do not abandon your·

sels to your rage, nor stain your hands

with your father's blood.”

Such were his piteous pleadings3 sor
my part, as if smitten by a thunderbolt,
I stood dumbfounded, unable to utter a
word, looking for Thisbe, who had stealthily
withdrawn. 1 gazed at the bed and round
the room, not knowing what to say or do.
