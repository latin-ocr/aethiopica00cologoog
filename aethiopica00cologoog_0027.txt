xviii INTRODUCTION

by Theophrastus, Ariston of lulis, Spho-
drius the Cynic, Favorinus of Artes, and
some of the intermingled dialogues and
stories which Plutarch has left us. It
was not until considerably later (perhaps
shortly before the time of Petronius)
that the love-stories, so brief in the
Milesian Fables, so rapid when they
were intermingled with history and his·
torical or philosophical romances, under·
went extended developments. The an·
cient stories of the Milesian class were
sometimes preserved, in the form of
episodeS‚ in the lengthy romances which
came into being during the Roman and
Byzantine periods; but, as a rule, they
were lost in fuller and more extended
narratives, which embraced a longer
period of time and surrounded the prm·
cipal incident and the chief characters
with a number of secondary incidents and
characters. The transition from the tale
to the romance did not take place with·
out an effort.

It is sufficient to compare the Lucius
and the Metamorphoses of Apuleius to see
how completely artificia! was the method
which combined a number of episodic
tales with the fable of romance‚ and how
obvious the “ soldering '' was.
