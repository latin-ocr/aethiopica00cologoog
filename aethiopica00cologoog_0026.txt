INTRODUCTION xvii

Such were the stories relating to
Rhodopis the courtesan. According to
some, she built one of the pyrami s ol
Egypt by inviting each of her lovers to

bnng a stone, according to otherS, she ·
became queen of Egypt thanks to the '

loss of her slipper, like Cinderella. The
name of Rhodopis is as dear tothe
Greek mance-writers as that ol Helen
is to the poete. In The enas and
Chariclen, the seductione o another
Rhodopis nearly triumphed over the
austerity of a high priest of Memphis;
and in Leucippe and Clitoplron, we meet
with another Rhodopis, but this time so
pure and virtuous as to provoke the wrath
oi the goddess ol Love. Plutarch, in
his Moralia, mentionS, together with the
Panthea of Xenophon, the Timoclea ol
Aristobulus and the Thebe of Theo·
om us. This list might be increased
ly the stories of this class which have

been extracted from history by Conon, ’

Parthenius, and Plutarch.

The Milesian Tale passed from history
into the writings ol philosophers It has
lest its traces in the Symposium oi
Xenophon, the Tnario upon Loue by
Clearchus of Soli, some similar works
