coast lor a distance ol about two stades,

lake which lay below. The whole district
is called Bucolia (Pastore) hythe Egyptians.

very deep in the middle, while its shores .
are shallow and marshy; lor the waters
ol lakes, like those ol the sea, diminish in

the brigands ol Egypt. Some dwell in
huts which they have built upon rising
ground above the level ol the water, while
others live in boats, which they use both
lor habitation and purposes ol transport;
it is here that their wives spin, and are

brought to bed. Their children are first
