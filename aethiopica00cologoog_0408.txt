THE AETHIOPICA 173

his affliction and the ardour ol the passion
by which his beart, which had never lelt
the lire ol love, was consumed, required
prompt treatment. He swore that he had
never known a woman, that he had always
spurned them and despised the idea ol
love and marriage, until Chariclea's beauty
had proved to him that he was naturally
weak, but that he had never until then
beheld a woman worthy ol his love. At
the same time he shed tears, to show that
he had been overcome by a woman against
his will. Ι tried to comfort and console
him, saying: ‘Do not despair, since you
have had recourse to me3 she will not be
able to prevail against my wisdom. lt
is true that her morale are austere, and
that it may he a hard task to bring her
to love, since she hstes even the very name
ol Venus and marriage; but lor your sake
Iwiil do all I can3 art can conquer nature;
only do not lose courage, and be ready
to ohey my commanda implicitly.' He
promised to follow my instructions, even

though 1 should bid him walk over naked
swords.
