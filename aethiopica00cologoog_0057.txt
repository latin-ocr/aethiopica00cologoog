siris and those under his protection to
the coast ol Egypt. On the banks of
the Nile, Trachinus, the captain ol the
pirates, prepares aleast to solemnise his
nuptials with Chariclea, but Calasiris
with considerable ingenuit ,having per·
suaded Pelorus, the secon in command,
that Chariclea is enamoured ol him, a
contest naturally arises between him and
Trachinus during the least, and the other
pirates, espousing different sides os the
quarrel, are all slain except Pelorus, who
is attacked and put to flight by Theagenes.
The stratagem oi Calasrris, however, is of
little avail, except to himself, sor, imme·
diately aiter the contest, while Calasiris
is sitting on a hill at some distance,
Theagenes and Chariclea are seized
by a band of E tian robbers, who
conduct them to teir haunt on an
island on a remote lake. Thyamis,
the captain of the banditti, becomes en-
amoured ol Chariclea, and declares his

intention of espousingl her. Chariclea

pretends that s e is t e sister oi Thea·
genes, in order that the jealous os the
robber may not be excited, and the salety
ol her lover endangered. This deception
is practised in other parts ol the romance.
