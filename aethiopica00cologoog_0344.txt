shrine, they shall cleave the waves, and
arrive at the countries darkened by the
heat ol the sun. There they shall receive
the noble meed os a virtuous life, a snowy
crown on their dusky brows.’

XXXVI. “At this declaration os the
God, those who stood by were greatly
perplexed, and ashed one another what
might be the meaning os the oracle ; each
interpreted the words in his own way and
explained them in a manner that accorded

with admiration, and eager to see the
sacred procession, which was on a mag·
nificent scale, did not trouble about exactly
understanding the meaning of the oracle.
